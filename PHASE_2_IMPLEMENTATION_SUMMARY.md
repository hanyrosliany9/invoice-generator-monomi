# Phase 2: Accounting Integration - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Duration:** 1 session
**Deliverable:** Revenue Recognition Automation for PSAK 72 Compliance

---

## Overview

Phase 2 implements automatic revenue recognition and financial reporting compliant with Indonesian accounting standard PSAK 72. The system now automatically triggers revenue recognition when invoices are paid, creating proper accounting entries and generating compliance reports.

**Phase 1 Recap:** Database models, PaymentMilestonesService, and basic API endpoints (✅ Complete)
**Phase 2 Focus:** Accounting automation, event-driven architecture, financial reporting (✅ Complete)

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. InvoicePaymentListener (Event-Driven Architecture)
**File:** `backend/src/modules/invoices/listeners/invoice-payment.listener.ts`

Automatically triggers revenue recognition when invoices are paid using NestJS event emitter pattern.

**Key Features:**
- Listens for `invoice.paid` events (when invoice reaches PAID_OFF status)
- Listens for `invoice.payment.confirmed` events (when payment is confirmed)
- Automatically recognizes revenue for linked project milestones
- Emits `invoice.revenue-recognized` event after processing
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

**Events Handled:**
```typescript
// Triggered when invoice is fully paid
@OnEvent('invoice.paid')
async handleInvoicePaid(event: { invoiceId: string; userId?: string })

// Triggered when payment is confirmed
@OnEvent('invoice.payment.confirmed')
async handlePaymentConfirmed(event: { invoiceId: string; paymentId: string; amount: number })
```

**Workflow:**
```
Invoice marked PAID_OFF
    ↓
EventEmitter emits 'invoice.paid' event
    ↓
InvoicePaymentListener catches event
    ↓
Calls RevenueRecognitionService.recognizeRevenueFromInvoicePayment()
    ↓
Recognizes revenue for linked project milestone (100% complete)
    ↓
Creates accounting journal entries (Debit Unbilled Revenue, Credit Revenue)
    ↓
Emits 'invoice.revenue-recognized' event for downstream processing
```

### 2. Enhanced RevenueRecognitionService
**File:** `backend/src/modules/accounting/services/revenue-recognition.service.ts`

Added two new Phase 2 methods for invoice-driven revenue recognition and dashboard reporting.

#### Method 1: `recognizeRevenueFromInvoicePayment(invoiceId: string)`
Automatically triggered by InvoicePaymentListener when invoice is paid.

**Logic:**
1. Fetch invoice with linked project milestone
2. Validate invoice status is PAID_OFF
3. If no project milestone linked, skip (return informational message)
4. Call `recognizeMilestoneRevenue()` with 100% completion
5. Creates proper journal entries per PSAK 72
6. Returns revenue recognition details

**Return Value:**
```typescript
{
  invoiceId: string,
  milestoneId: string,
  revenueRecognized: number,
  message: string
}
```

#### Method 2: `getRevenueDashboardSummary(startDate?: Date, endDate?: Date)`
Generates comprehensive revenue summary for dashboard and reporting.

**Metrics Provided:**
- **Recognized Revenue:** Amount of revenue already recognized (PSAK 72 compliant)
- **Deferred Revenue:** Advance payments received but not yet earned
- **Pending Revenue:** Invoiced but not yet recognized
- **Recognition Rate:** Percentage of total invoiced revenue that has been recognized

**Return Structure:**
```typescript
{
  period: { startDate, endDate },
  recognizedRevenue: { total, count },
  deferredRevenue: { total, count },
  pendingRevenue: { total, count },
  summary: {
    totalInvoiced: number,
    recognitionRate: percentage
  }
}
```

### 3. Revenue Dashboard Controller Endpoints
**File:** `backend/src/modules/accounting/accounting.controller.ts`

Added 6 new REST endpoints for revenue reporting and management.

#### Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Role Required |
|--------|----------|---------|---|
| GET | `/accounting/revenue/dashboard` | Revenue dashboard summary | FINANCE_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT |
| GET | `/accounting/revenue/recognized` | Recognized revenue by period | FINANCE_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT |
| GET | `/accounting/revenue/deferred` | Deferred revenue report | FINANCE_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT |
| GET | `/accounting/revenue/by-project` | Revenue breakdown by project | FINANCE_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT |
| GET | `/accounting/revenue/milestones/:projectId` | Milestone revenue for project | FINANCE_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT |
| POST | `/accounting/revenue/recognize/:invoiceId` | Manually trigger recognition | FINANCE_MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT |

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Get revenue dashboard with date range
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/accounting/revenue/dashboard?startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2025-10-31"

# Get revenue by project
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/accounting/revenue/by-project"

# Get milestone revenue for specific project
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/accounting/revenue/milestones/{projectId}"

# Manually trigger revenue recognition
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/accounting/revenue/recognize/{invoiceId}"
```
