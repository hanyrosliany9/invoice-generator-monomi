## Executive Summary

### System Overview
Monomi Finance is a comprehensive Indonesian business management and accounting system built with modern technology stack (NestJS, React 19, PostgreSQL, Prisma). The system provides end-to-end business workflow from quotations to invoicing, with integrated accounting modules supporting Indonesian compliance requirements.

### Key Strengths
- ✅ **Complete Accounting Integration**: Full double-entry bookkeeping with chart of accounts, journal entries, general ledger, and financial statements
- ✅ **Indonesian Compliance**: PSAK 16/71/72/57 support, PPN (11% VAT), PPh withholding, Materai system
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 8 roles with 50+ granular permissions
- ✅ **Project-Based Billing**: Complete quotation-to-invoice workflow with approval system
- ✅ **Modern Tech Stack**: React 19, NestJS 11, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Docker-first architecture
- ✅ **Expense & Asset Management**: ECL provisions (PSAK 71), depreciation tracking (PSAK 16)

### Critical Gaps Identified
- ❌ **No e-Faktur Integration**: Missing government-mandated electronic tax invoice system
- ❌ **No Coretax Integration**: Not integrated with DJP's new core tax system (mandatory since Jan 1, 2025)
- ❌ **No Inventory Management**: Missing sales orders, purchase orders, warehouse management
- ❌ **Limited Purchase-to-Pay**: Basic structure exists but incomplete vendor/PO workflow
- ❌ **No Multi-Warehouse**: Single location assumption, no inter-warehouse transfers
- ❌ **No Job Costing**: Missing detailed cost tracking per project phase/activity

### Priority Recommendations
1. **URGENT**: Implement e-Faktur & Coretax integration (government compliance requirement)
2. **HIGH**: Complete sales order and inventory management modules
3. **HIGH**: Enhance purchase-to-pay workflow with complete PO and goods receipt process
4. **MEDIUM**: Implement multi-warehouse and inventory transfers

## Conclusion

Monomi Finance has a **solid foundation** with comprehensive accounting features, modern technology stack, and good Indonesian compliance (PSAK 16/71). However, **critical gaps** exist in government-mandated tax integration (e-Faktur, Coretax) and core business features (inventory, sales orders, job costing).

**Immediate Priority**: Implement e-Faktur and Coretax integration to ensure legal compliance. Without these, businesses cannot legally operate in Indonesia post-2025.

**Secondary Priority**: Complete inventory management and sales order modules to compete with market leaders like Accurate and Zahir.

**Long-term Vision**: Enhance project accounting with job costing to serve construction and project-based businesses effectively, differentiating from generic accounting software.

**Competitive Advantage**: Monomi's modern tech stack (React 19, NestJS 11), superior RBAC implementation, and project-focused workflow provide differentiation opportunities. Focus on construction/project-based businesses where Accurate/Zahir have limited features.

**Estimated Investment**: 9-12 months of development (2-3 backend devs, 2 frontend devs, 1 QA, domain expert) to reach feature parity with market leaders plus competitive advantages in project management.
