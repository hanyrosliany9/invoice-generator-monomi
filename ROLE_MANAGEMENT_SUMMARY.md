- Compiled permission-based authorization patterns

### 4. **Complete Implementation Plan**
- 50+ page detailed implementation roadmap
- Database schema changes with Prisma models
- Backend implementation (services, guards, decorators)
- Frontend implementation (hooks, components, UI guards)
- 4-week timeline with daily tasks
- Testing strategy and rollout plan

## üö® Critical Findings

### Security Vulnerabilities Discovered

| Issue | Severity | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Any user can approve their own quotations | **CRITICAL** | Violates segregation of duties |
| Any user can mark invoices as paid | **CRITICAL** | Financial fraud risk |
| Company settings (NPWP, bank accounts) accessible to all | **HIGH** | Data exposure |
| Accounting operations unprotected | **CRITICAL** | Financial data manipulation |
| No approval workflow enforcement | **HIGH** | Compliance violation |

### Current Coverage
- **2 controllers** protected (Expenses only)
- **48+ controllers** unprotected
- **~96% of endpoints** lack role-based access control

## ‚ú® Proposed Solution

### New Role Structure

```
SUPER_ADMIN        ‚Üí Full system access (Owner/IT)
FINANCE_MANAGER    ‚Üí Approve transactions, financial operations
ACCOUNTANT         ‚Üí Accounting operations, reports (no approvals)
PROJECT_MANAGER    ‚Üí CRUD operations, submit for approval
STAFF              ‚Üí Create drafts, basic operations
VIEWER             ‚Üí Read-only access
```

### Permission System

**50+ granular permissions** across 10 categories:
- Quotations (7 permissions)
- Invoices (7 permissions)
- Expenses (7 permissions)
- Accounting (4 permissions)
- Users (5 permissions)
- Settings (2 permissions)
- Projects, Clients, Assets, Reports (4-5 each)

### Key Features

1. **Hybrid RBAC + Permissions**
   - Role-based for simplicity
   - Permission-based for granularity
   - Flexible and scalable

2. **Segregation of Duties**
   - Enforced at database level
   - Cannot approve own quotations/invoices
   - Audit trail for all approvals

3. **Resource-Based Authorization**
   - Users see only their data
   - Managers see team data
   - Admins see everything

4. **Approval Workflows**
   - Multi-level approval support
   - Status tracking
   - Notification system
